# .dotfiles
Contains a selection of configuration files that can be easily tracked and updated, then symlinked to.

## .vimrc
Vim configuration.  Requires [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as a package manager.  Needs a powerline font for the theme. I use [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).
