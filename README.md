# .dotfiles
Contains a selection of configuration files that can be easily tracked and updated, then symlinked to.

## .vimrc
Vim configuration.  Requires [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as a package manager; it will be automatically installed on first run.  Needs a powerline font for the theme. I use [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).
